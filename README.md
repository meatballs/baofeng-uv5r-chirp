==================
Chirp files for the Baofeng UV-5R dual band transceiver

Channel definitions are specified in chirp files within the 'channel_definitions' directory.

build.rb is a ruby file which merges the definitions into 'radio_config.chirp'

Two image files exist within the 'images' directory: an empty image containing settings only (no channels) and a full images with all channels.
